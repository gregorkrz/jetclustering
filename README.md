# SVJ clustering
The repo has evolved from [here](https://github.com/selvaggi/mlpf) - mainly, we use the dataloader and code for reading  the root files for the previous MLPF project

## Setup
**Important**: To make it easier and less time-consuming to move the commands across different machines, i.e. lxplus, T3 and Vega, we use relative paths. However, all commands can also be supplied absolute paths starting with `/`. **In case you use relative paths, make sure to modify the `env.sh` file with your paths!**
0. Environment setup
We use the environment defined in the following container: `gkrz/lgatr:v3`
1. Set the environment variables `source env.sh`


### Preprocess data
See the script at `sbatch jobs/preprocess_v0.slurm` (make sure to update your local `env.sh` file!)

## Evaluation of clustering

For AK8: `python -m scripts.analysis.count_matched_quarks --input scouting_PFNano_signals/SVJ_hadronic_std --dataset-cap 1000`
For AK8 GenJets: `python -m scripts.analysis.count_matched_quarks --input scouting_PFNano_signals/SVJ_hadronic_std --dataset-cap 1000 --jets-object genjets`
For any model: `python -m scripts.analysis.count_matched_quarks --input scouting_PFNano_signals/SVJ_hadronic_std --output scouting_PFNano_signals2/SVJ_hadronic_std/all_models_eval/GATr_rinv_03_m_900  --eval-dir train/Test_betaPt_BC_all_datasets_2025_01_07_17_50_45  --dataset-cap 1000 --jets-object model_jets` (Add `--eval-dir` with the path to the eval run containing the clustering and the jets. Optionally, add --clustering-suffix in case there are multiple clusterings saved in the file.)

The script produces output in the `results` folder. The script goes over the events up to dataset-cap (optional). 


### Training models

### Datasets

`scouting_PFNano_signals1`: Contains special PFCands and PFCands in separate fields

`scouting_PFNano_signals2`: Contains both special PFCands and PFCands in the same field, under PFCands.

It was easier to just create this instead of always having special treatment for the special PFCands. As of January 2025, we are only using this version, accessible at `/pnfs/psi.ch/cms/trivcat/store/user/gkrzmanc/jetclustering/preprocessed_data/scouting_PFNano_signals2`.
